[![Paper: IEEE Aerospace 2026](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paper-IEEEAero_2026-B31B1B.svg)](https://github.com/MaxAurelius/ground-station-optimizer) This repository contains the official implementation for the paper **"From Theory to Practice: An Operationally-Focused IP Model for GSaaS Procurement"**, to be presented at the 2026 IEEE Aerospace Conference. Currently in the Peer Review.

Our work introduces the **Operational Complexity Penalty (OCP)**, a critical enhancement to the ground station selection model originally proposed by Eddy et al. While the baseline model is theoretically sound, it often produces fragmented, operationally unviable networks. The OCP-enhanced model resolves this theory-practice gap, delivering solutions that are not only high-performing but also manageable and capital-efficient.

## Our Contribution: The Operational Complexity Penalty (OCP)

The core innovation of this work is a regularization term that penalizes network complexity. This transforms the optimization problem from a pure data-maximization task into a strategic decision-making tool.

* **Solves the Theory-Practice Gap:** Prevents the selection of operationally expensive assets that offer only marginal utility.
* **Reduces Complexity:** Our results show a **54% reduction in network size** while retaining nearly **85% of the maximum data throughput**.
* **Self-Calibrating & Economically Rational:** The penalty is not arbitrary. It's dynamically scaled based on the median data-to-cost efficiency of the specific scenario, making the trade-off between performance and complexity coherent and data-driven.

This repository provides the code to replicate our findings and apply the OCP-enhanced model to new satellite constellation scenarios.

## Reproducing Paper Results

To reproduce the key figures and results from the paper, you can use the simulation data archived in the `/paper_results` directory.

1.  Ensure all dependencies are installed (see Installation section below).
2.  The main results from the paper can be generated by running:

```bash
cd sim_results/
python3 plot_results.py
python3 plot_budget_comparison_all_runs.py
````

This script will load the pre-computed simulation data from `/sim_results` and generate the Pareto frontier (Fig. 1) and budget sensitivity analysis (Fig. 2) plots.

## Installation

The repository relies on an ILP solver. **Gurobi is strongly recommended for performance.** Free alternatives like CBC or SCIP can be used but are significantly slower.

### 1\. Install an ILP Solver

Follow the original documentation for installing Gurobi, CBC, or SCIP. For `cbc` on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install coinor-cbc coinor-libcbc-dev
```

### 2\. Set up Python Environment (uv recommended)

```bash
# Install a supported python version
uv python install 3.12

# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv -p 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install project dependencies
uv pip install -e .
```

## Using the OCP Model

The OCP logic is implemented within the core library. To run a new optimization using our model:

  * The OCP objective function is defined in `gsopt/milp_objectives.py`.
  * The experimental harness used for the paper is in `run_experiments.py`. This is the best starting point for modification.
